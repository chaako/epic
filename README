Electrostatic Plasma Interaction Code (EPIC)

To build:
autoreconf -i
./configure
make

If environmental variable CXX is set, need to do './configure CXX=' for
mpi wrapper to be detected correctly.

To force serial build do './configure --with-mpi=no'.

At present, need to set library path to run, e.g.:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=:/home/chaako/epic/fmdb/fmdbSerial/lib:/home/chaako/epic/vtk/VTK/install/lib/vtk-5.10/:/home/chaako/epic/netgen/opt/netgen/lib:

The fmdb includes use absolute paths, so if the epic dir is moved fmdb
should be rebuilt.


Mesh notes:

Create model in Blender and export as stl from edit mode.

Import stl in engrid, flip boundaries such that green faces away from
interior, select surface by hovering and pressing p, set boundary
codes of the unperturbed plasma to 5 and the collecting surfaces to 4
(to display again after setting press v), edit boundary conditions to
create green volume, create volume mesh, and save as egc file
(produces .vtu file as well).

Load .vtu file from enGrid in VisIt, make mesh plot, export (with
variable 'cell_code' which labels the surfaces) as MOAB VTK file
(straight VisIt VTK export contains additional lines which crash the
FMDB VTK reader), and change the line 'SCALARS cell_code double 1' to
'SCALARS cell_code int' since it should be an integer tag (and the 1
throws off the vtk reader).

If a field name in [output].sms matches all the first characters of
another field name it appears that the VisIt plugin is unable to
distinguish them (i.e. potential and potential01 are not distinct).
