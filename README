Electrostatic Plasma Interaction Code (EPIC)

To build:
autoreconf -i
./configure
make

At present, need to set library path to run, e.g.:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/chaako/epic/fmdb/fmdbSerial//lib

For now, using the Vegas algorithm from the Cuba library appears to
require extracting the object file from the archive with 'ar x
../cuba/Cuba-3.0/libcuba.a Vegas.o' from the src directory.


Mesh notes:

Load .vtu file from enGrid in VisIt, make mesh plot, export (with
variable 'cell_code' which labels the surfaces) as MOAB VTK file
(straight VisIt VTK export contains additional lines which crash the
FMDB VTK reader), and change the line 'SCALARS cell_code double 1' to
'SCALARS cell_code int' since it should be an integer tag (and the 1
throws off the vtk reader).
