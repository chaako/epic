Electrostatic Plasma Interaction Code (EPIC)


Mesh notes:

Load .vtu file in VisIt, make mesh plot, and export as MOAB VTK file
(straight VisIt VTK export contains additional lines which crash the
FMDB VTK reader). The variable cell_code labels the surfaces, and can
be included in the VTK file (though FMDB doesn't load it).
