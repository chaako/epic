Electrostatic Plasma Interaction Code (EPIC)

To build:
autoreconf -i
./configure
make

If environmental variable CXX is set, need to do './configure CXX=' for
mpi wrapper to be detected correctly.

At present, need to set library path to run, e.g.:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=:/home/chaako/epic/fmdb/fmdbSerial/lib:/home/chaako/epic/vtk/VTK/install/lib/vtk-5.10/:

The fmdb includes use absolute paths, so if the epic dir is moved fmdb
should be rebuilt.


Mesh notes:

Load .vtu file from enGrid in VisIt, make mesh plot, export (with
variable 'cell_code' which labels the surfaces) as MOAB VTK file
(straight VisIt VTK export contains additional lines which crash the
FMDB VTK reader), and change the line 'SCALARS cell_code double 1' to
'SCALARS cell_code int' since it should be an integer tag (and the 1
throws off the vtk reader).

If a field name in [output].sms matches all the first characters of
another field name it appears that the VisIt plugin is unable to
distinguish them (i.e. potential and potential01 are not distinct).
